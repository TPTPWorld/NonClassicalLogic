Subject: Re: Benchmarks Modal Logic

Hi Clemens and Geoff,

The benchmarks we have used for the IJCAR 2022 paper can be found in the
following links:

(in the language of KSP) https://nalon.org/software/ijcar2022-ksp.tgz
(intohilo format) https://nalon.org/software/ijcar2022-intohylo.tgz

Clemens, there is also a collection of formulae in the latest distribution of
KSP (https://nalon.org/software/ksp-0.1.5-beta.tar.gz; that's the submission
version for IJCAR; I'll update my page soon with the final version), in the
folder "examples". Those are very simple formulae, but I find them particularly
useful when debugging. There are links to the literature within each file
(unless the example is ours); the files have suffix n (for
non-provable/satisfiable) and p (for provable/unsatisfiable) that indicates the
status of each formula for each different logic. Note that for both formats the
files already contain the negation the formulae we want to prove.

My colleagues and I are always looking for fully automated provers for modal
logics. Can you please let us know when your implementation in Vampire is
available?

All the best,
Cl√°udia

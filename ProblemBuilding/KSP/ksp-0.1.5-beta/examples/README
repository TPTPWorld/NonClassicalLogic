The folder ksp/examples contains a set of formulae for some of the modal logics that the prover can deal with.

The names of the subfolders give some clear indication of the logics to which the formulae belong. Moreover, I have annotated the names of the files with p (for unsatisfiable formulae) or n (for satisfiable formula) to indicate what is the expected status of each formula within each logic.

Whenever the examples are provided by other people I have annotated the files with references. Those that do not have annotations were devised by Ullrich Hustadt, Fabio Papacchini, and/or myself. The folder sigley_mph contains a set of parameterised formula due to Sarah Sigley (see her PhD Thesis, Proof Complexity of Modal Resolution Systems, 2019, University of Leeds, Chapter 9; I have also added the reference for the paper in the Journal of Automated Reasoning below).

Most of the formulae in this small collection are not exactly challenging. The intention is really to provide some small examples for testing. Sarah's formulae are good! I have managed to solve six of the nine problems, using all that I know about KSP's settings within 1800 seconds.

All problems are codified in the KSP input format.

If you find any problem, please let me know by emailing to nalon@unb.br

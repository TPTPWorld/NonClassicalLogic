## Files
* see corrections.txt what QMLTP problems have been buggy, fixed or removed
* qmltp_thf: QMLTP library converted to THF format with modal extension, equality symbols have been replaced by a fresh constant (qmltpeq) since "=" has a defined meaning in THF
* qmltp_thf_native_eq_only: QMLTP library converted to THF format with modal extension, contains only problems with equality, equalities are expressed through symbol "=" which has a defined meaning in THF

## Misc
* MML problems contain exactly one semantics specification but are not known to have the correct semantics specification (if such a thing exists)
* all other problems do not contain a semantics specification

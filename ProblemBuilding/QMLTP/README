The 0_QMF-v1.1 directory not in the repository. Locally it is the original 
QMLTP library (I believe!). It includes Axioms (none of which are used) and 
Documents (with results from experiments, etc.). The 0_QMF-v1.1.md file
provides direct links to the QMLTP online.

The 1_QMF directory is not in the repository. Locally it is just the 
Problems from 0_QMF-v1.1, so I had a clean starting point.

The 2_NH0 directory is the Problems in THF with corrections, a default 
semantics specification, and types. I converted the "#box :" style to 
"{$box} @".

The 3_NX0 directory is 2_NH0 converted to NX0, done by Alex using one of 
his tools.

The 4_NX0_SEMs directory is 3_NX0 with draft headers added. A single logic 
specification is used $rigid-$cumulative-$modal_system_K. 7_QMLTP is (the
start of) getting the headers finished.

The 7_QMLTP directory is the final form of the TPTP-format version of the
QMLTP library (akin to the MPTPTP dataset), for the logic specification
$rigid-$cumulative-$modal_system_K in all but the MML domain, where each
problem has the logic specification from the QMLTP.

The 8_QMLTP directory is expanded versions of 7_QMLTP with all combinations
of the specification parameters.

FIXED PROBLEMS:
APM007+1.p: symbol "qmltpeq" without axiomatization
SYM052+1.p: symbol "!=" without axiomatization
SYM054+1.p: symbol "qmltpeq" without axiomatization
SYM055+1.p: symbol "=" without axiomatization
SYM056+1.p: symbol "=" without axiomatization
SYM057+1.p: symbol "=" without axiomatization
SYM058+1.p: symbol "qmltpeq" without axiomatization
SYM064+1.p: symbol "=" without axiomatization
SYM068+1.p: symbol "=" and "qmltpeq" without axiomatization
SYM069+1.p: symbol "qmltpeq" without axiomatization
SYM070+1.p: symbol "qmltpeq" without axiomatization
SYM071+1.p: symbol "qmltpeq" without axiomatization
SYM072+1.p: symbol "qmltpeq" without axiomatization
SYM085+1.p: symbol "=" without axiomatization
MML006+1.p: semantics typo poor instead of pour
            semantics for make(c) missing, added axiomatization k for make(c)
            changed pour(a) to pour_a and pour(b) to pour_b and make(c) to make_c
MML009+1.p: conjecture had . instead of : after #box(wu)
MML010+1.p: conjecture had . instead of : after #box(wu)
MML014+1.p: semantics fo i(bob) missing, added axiomatization s5 for i(bob)
            changed i(alice) to i_alice and i(bob) to i_bob and b(alice) to b_alice and b(bob) to b_bob
MML016+1.p: changed b(s) to b_s and b(u) to b_u
MML020+1.p: missing comma in axiom 7


PROBABLY STILL INCORRECT:
APM004+1.p: parentheses (fixed, probably wrong)
SYM035+1.p: parentheses (fixed, probably wrong)
SYM082+1.p: parentheses (fixed, probably wrong)
SYM113+1.p: parentheses (fixed, probably wrong)
SYM114+1.p: parentheses (fixed, probably wrong)
SYM122+1.p: parentheses (fixed, probably wrong)
SYM163+1.p: parentheses (fixed, probably wrong)
MML002+1.p: removed superfluous parentheses from axiom_4_for_fool_2
            added needed parentheses for first operand of implication in axiom axiom_4_for_fool_2
MML003+1.p: right operand of equivalence in axiom someone_knows_its_forhead misses parentheses
MML004+1.p: missing parentheses around second operand of implication in axiom axiom_2
MML005+1.p: a lot of missing parentheses around the first operand (which had a modality) of implications. This does not conform to TPTP FOF style
            several duplicate axiom names
MML008+1.p: additional ). ending removed
MML013+1.p: missing parenthese at the end of axiom not_a_axiom_1
MML015+1.p: changed i(alice) to i_alice and i(bob) to i_bob and b(alice) to b_alice and b(bob) to b_bob
            missing parentheses in axioms axiom_1_a and axiom_1_b after #box(i(alice) and #box(i(bob)
            one parenthese too much at the end of axioms axiom_1_a and axiom_1_b
            conjecture missing parentheses before first #box(b_bob) and after second bigcity(portland)
MML017+1.p: mistakes in axioms with phi (parentheses)
MML019+1.p: many mistakes (parentheses)

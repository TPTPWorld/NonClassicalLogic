MML:
2: removed superfluous parentheses from axiom_4_for_fool_2
   added needed parentheses for first operand of implication in axiom axiom_4_for_fool_2

3: right operand of equivalence in axiom someone_knows_its_forhead misses parentheses

4: missing parentheses around second operand of implication in axiom axiom_2

5: a lot of missing parentheses around the first operand (which had a modality) of implications. This does not conform to TPTP FOF style
   several duplicate axiom names

6: semantics poor instead of pour
   semantics for make(c) missing, added axiomatization k for make(c)
   changed pour(a) to pour_a and pour(b) to pour_b and make(c) to make_c

8: additional ). ending removed

9: conjecture had . instead of : after #box(wu)

10: conjecture had . instead of : after #box(wu)

13: missing parenthese at the end of axiom not_a_axiom_1

14: semantics fo i(bob) missing, added axiomatization s5 for i(bob)
    changed i(alice) to i_alice and i(bob) to i_bob and b(alice) to b_alice and b(bob) to b_bob

15: changed i(alice) to i_alice and i(bob) to i_bob and b(alice) to b_alice and b(bob) to b_bob
    missing parentheses in axioms axiom_1_a and axiom_1_b after #box(i(alice) and #box(i(bob)
    one parenthese too much at the end of axioms axiom_1_a and axiom_1_b
    conjecture missing parentheses before first #box(b_bob) and after second bigcity(portland)

16: changed b(s) to b_s and b(u) to b_u

17: mistakes in axioms with phi (parentheses)

19: many mistakes (parentheses)

20: missing comma in axiom 7

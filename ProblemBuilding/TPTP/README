I attach the first version of the LWB benchmark set for modal logic K 
translated to NCL TPTP. These are roughly 380 problem files. As per the 
build-up of this benchmark set, every problem file in a folder ending 
with "_n" is a non-theorem, and ending with "_p" is a theorem. The 
original problems come from [1] (fmls_k.tar).

They could also be used with other modal logics, e.g., KT, KD, etc. In 
these modal logics some of the non-theorems might become theorems. They 
could also be represented as generators.

Best, Alex

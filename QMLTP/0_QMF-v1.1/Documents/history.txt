QMLTP-Library
History


v 1.1
- problem set: added problem domains NLP, SET, MUL
               NLP, SET: classical logic problems from TPTP library
               MUL: multi-modal first-order logic problems from
                    various papers on calculi and applications
- rating, status: updated for logics K, D, T, S4, S5,
                  varying, cumulative, constant domains  
- ATP system: MleanTAP: updated version 1.3
              embedding for higher-order ATP systems Leo-II, Satallax:
              updated for varying and cumultive domains
            

v 1.0.1
- problem set: status, rating updated because of updated set of 
               ATP systems (see below)
               and no equality, because axiomatization for equality  
               in first-order modal logics was different among the ATP systems
- ATP systems: additional systems: MleanCoP 1.2
               new versions of ATP systems: MleanSeP 1.2, MleanTAP 1.2               

v 1.0
- problem set: 500 problems
               320 first-order, 175 propositional
               problem domains: APM, GAL, GLC, GNL, GSE, GSV, GSY, SYM
               rating, status determined for 
               modal logics S4, D,
               constant, cumulative domains
- ATP systems: MleanSeP 1.1, MleanTAP 1.1, GQML-Prover 1.2,
               f2p+MSPASS 3.0, M-Satallax 1.4, M-Leo-II v1.2

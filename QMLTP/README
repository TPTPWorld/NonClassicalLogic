The 0_QMF-v1.1 directory not in the repository. Locally it is the original 
QMLTP library (I believe!). It includes Axioms (none of which are used) and 
Documents (with results from experiments, etc.). The 0_QMF-v1.1.md file
provides direct links to the QMLTP online.

The 1_QMF directory is not in the repository. Locally it is just the 
Problems from 0_QMF-v1.1, so I had a clean starting point.

The 2_NH0 directory is the Problems in THF with corrections, a default 
semantics specification, and types. I converted the "#box :" style to 
"{$box} @".

The 3_NX0 directory is 2_NH0 converted to NX0, done by Alex using one of 
his tools.

The 4_NX0_SEMs directory is 3_NX0 expanded to 40 files per original file, 
for the 40 possible semantic specifications. Half of them are for flexible 
constants that we can't process yet. Now also merged in the non-flexible 
S5 problems from 4_NX0_SEMs but with S5U.

The 5_THF directory is 4_NX0_SEMs converted to TH0 by the embedding tool.

The 6_TPTP directory is a selectionfrom 5_THF that were added to TPTP v8.1.0,
using their new TPTP names. The rename mappings are in the Rename* files in
5_THF.

The 7_QMLTP directory is the final form of the TPTP-format version of the
QMLTP library (akin to the MPTPTP dataset)
